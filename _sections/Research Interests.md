<p style="text-align:justify">I love computer vision specifically in <b>saliency detection</b>, image <b>segmentation</b>, <b>recognition </b>and the application of  machine learning or <b>deep learning</b> into computer vision. Currently I am involved in my bachelor thesis about saliency detection based on GANs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, I also feel interested in <b>PGM, Bayesian</b> and consider the math as always the key point. </p>
