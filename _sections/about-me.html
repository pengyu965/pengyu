<p> I am a “Science is everything”. This is how I consider science and technology. Since the very young edge, I began to admire the great power of science and technology and obsessed in the beauty of them. So fortunately, I have been engaged in studying science since high school and later narrowed it to Electronic and Computer Engineering since 2014, when I joined the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am not born a genius but I think I get well prepared to pursue a higher degree based on my four-year study of ECE and two-year relevant research experience in computer vision and machine learning area. With the passion to be a great inventor and researcher in the future, I am determine to pursue a master degree in Big Data Technology to further enhance the specific knowledge.</p>
