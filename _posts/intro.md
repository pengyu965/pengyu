Saliency Detection based on GANs

<p style="text-align:justify">
Generate Adversarial Networks (GANs) have a very good potential to handle the end-to-end problems and saliency detection is exactly one of them. Thus this project aims at upgrading my former method by using deep learning way to segment the saliency area from a 3D video sequence. This is also the topic of my graduation thesis, supervised by Prof. Ping Zhang.
