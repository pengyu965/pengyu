Infrared Weak Target Detection based on CNN \\
Founded Engineering Project

<p style="text-align:justify">
Since the target is small and infrared, the feature of the target is very weak, which caused the great difficulty to recoginize the object. Thus a Convolutional Neural Networks was designed to utilize the limited feature with a high efficiency.
